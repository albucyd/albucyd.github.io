The [selfish gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene "Wikipedia: The Selfish Gene") turns out to be less of a gene then learned behaviour. In fact it seems that studying economics is making people statistically speaking more selfish. See [boing boing](https://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/04/economists-selfish-b.html "Boing Boing: Economists - selfish bastards") and [this article](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/economics_frank/frank.html "Gnu.org: Studying Economics") by Robert H. Frank, Thomas Gilovich, and Dennis T. Regan. That's just great.
